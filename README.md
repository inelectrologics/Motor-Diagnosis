# Motor-Diagnosis
Low-Cost MCU-based Motor Diagnosis Platform
The code here is tested implemented on ESP32-C3 Dual USB board.
Please ensure your compatibility for flash, ram, WiFi mode, pin numbers, adc configuration, adc timing and usb virtual serial port.
I found that the code can be compiled with "pass" and "upload successfully" on any other ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3 and ESP32-C6 with 4MB flash or more but I have tested on real signal capture and diagnosis on ESP32-C3 Dual USB only.
