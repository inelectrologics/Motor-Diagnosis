# Motor-Diagnosis
This is for main arduino code used to implemente diagnosis platform on MCU board.
The code here is tested and implemented on ESP32-C3 Dual USB board for motor signal diagnosis.
Please ensure your compatibility for flash, RAM, WiFi mode, pin numbers, ADC configuration, ADC timing and usb virtual serial port.
I found that the code can be compiled with "pass" and "upload successfully" on any other ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3 and ESP32-C6 with 4MB flash or more but I have tested on real signal capture and diagnosis on ESP32-C3 Dual USB only.
